# Svenager reference Ansible repository

This is the **reference implementation** of the Ansible repository convention
that the [Svenager](https://github.com/Klackwerk/Svenager) server can analyze
(embedded there as the `ansible/` submodule). It also ships the base role
every managed device gets (agent prerequisites, localhost-bound VNC server).

Real deployments keep their Ansible configuration in **separate git
repositories** registered in the Svenager UI — this repo documents the layout
they must follow and is fully testable on its own (no Svenager required). To
get started, it can also be registered directly as an Ansible source:
`https://github.com/Klackwerk/ansible-svenager.git`.

## Convention (analyzed by the server)

```
roles/<name>/meta/main.yml            # galaxy_info.description → role card text
roles/<name>/meta/argument_specs.yml  # typed variables → friendly UI forms
roles/<name>/defaults/main.yml        # default values shown in the UI
svenager.yml                          # optional: display names, which roles
                                      #   are user-assignable vs internal
```

The server only **parses** repository content — it never executes anything
from it on the server side. Devices run roles locally with
`ansible-playbook -c local` against a pinned commit.

## Roles

- **svenager_base** *(base — applied automatically)*: the packages every
  managed device needs to run jobs.
- **vnc_server** *(assignable)*: localhost-bound VNC server for the remote
  view (wayvnc by default, x11vnc for X11 sessions).
- **motd_banner** *(base — applied automatically)*: large `/etc/motd` banner
  telling anyone at the console that the device is enrolled in Svenager,
  including the instance URL.
- **kde_desktop** *(assignable)*: KDE Plasma for Debian 13 workstations with
  Windows-familiar defaults and OnlyOffice as the default office suite.
- **notebook** *(assignable)*: laptop optimizations (TLP, zram).
- **kiosk** *(assignable)*: boots a Raspberry Pi OS Lite / Debian console
  image into a fullscreen web kiosk — sway compositor + cog (WPE WebKit)
  showing `kiosk_url`, with its own localhost-bound wayvnc for remote view
  and control (set `kiosk_compositor: cage` for a watch-only fallback).
  By default it shows a status page stored on the device (survives server
  and network outages, with "Svenager server" and "Internet" reachability
  flags fed by `<instance>/kiosk-demo/<device-id>/status`). Set
  `kiosk_second_url` to show a second page fullscreen on
  `kiosk_second_output` (default `HDMI-A-2`), with `kiosk_url` on
  `kiosk_output` (default `HDMI-A-1`) keeping keyboard focus. Set
  `kiosk_resolution: 1920x1080` to keep a Raspberry Pi off 4K screens.
  On a Pi the compositor renders on the v3d render node
  (`kiosk_render_device: auto`); rendering on the vc4 display controller
  leaves the browser's web content on software GL at full CPU load.

The agent injects `svenager_server_url` and `svenager_device_id` as
extra-vars with every job, so role defaults can reference the managing
instance. The server additionally injects `svenager_hostname` — the device
name maintained in the Svenager UI — which the base role applies as the
system hostname.

## Testing

```bash
ansible-lint
molecule test   # against a Debian container (display-less parts only)
```
